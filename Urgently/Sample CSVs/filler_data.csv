"**REQUESTING STOP SIGN TO BE INSTALLED** SPANISH Buenas noches, quiero ver la manera de como me pueden ayudar o decirme a donde me puedo dirigir con este problema que ya es muy comÃƒÂºn en mi cuadra. Vivo en la 6064 Wunderlin Ave. San Diego Ca 92114 y el problema que tenemos los vecinos de esta cuadra es que los carros pasan a muy alta velocidad por que esta cuadra se presta por que hay un pequeno desnivel de la cuadra y agarran mas velicidad los carros. En los 15 anos que tenemos viviendo aquÃƒÂ­, ah habido por lo menos 8 accidentes en los ÃƒÂºltimos anos. chocan nuestros carros estacionados, muchos se dan a la fuga como el de esta noche. En una ocasiÃƒÂ³n hubo lesionados y la verdad esto es una situaciÃƒÂ³n muy alarmante. QuisiÃƒÂ©ramos poner un alto a esto antes de que cause algo mas grave en nuestra cuadra. Por su atenciÃƒÂ³n muchas gracias esperando tener respuesta alguna."

2 construction vehicles (one truck and one car) are parked on a narrow street and sharp turn. Their vehicles force oncoming traffic into the opposite lane causing a very dangerous situation .

For some reason these guys don?t get it. It might be necessary to paint the curb red for those that don?t understand that you can?t park your car in the middle of the street.

"A City storm drain behind and above our property, and adjoining Whispering Ridge Homeowners Association (WRHOA) property, is situated at the top of a high ridge on Fairbrook Road. This City storm drain diverts street storm water from Fairbrook Road and dumps it onto the open slope directly behind our property. The resulting flow of storm water comes down with great force and has eroded the slope, creating a deep open gully through which the storm water rapidly flows and moves rocks, debris and mud down the hillside. This whole mess runs into horizontal culverts on WRHOA property for collection into a drainage pipe/ head wall installed by the City on and under our property at 12403 Kingspine Avenue. This has caused flooding on our property when it becomes clogged and blocked at its entry point with mud, rock and debris brought down after heavy rain by the storm water. WE NEED ACCUMULATED MUD, ROCKS AND DEBRIS REMOVED AND A SOLUTION TO THIS RECURRING SERIOUS PROBLEM DUE TO POOR DRAINAGE DESIGN. NEED SITE VISIT."

"A massive rectangular sunken pothole has formed in the median lane near Domino's Pizza at 5185 College Ave as College Avenue bisects the SDSU campus. The pothole is getting worse by the day. If a motorist is driving more than 10-15 mph, the pothole is jarring and will damage vehicles. Thousands of vehicles travel this road each day. A repair is imperative. During the SDSU Christmas break is a perfect time to repair the pavement due to fewer vehicles from faculty, staff, and students. This pothole will cost the city's risk management department a lot of money in repairs if this pothole is not fixed."

By accounts from the property owners and business owners, the person sleeps on the steps in the attached photo.
