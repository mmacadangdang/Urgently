Western at sdpdwestern@pd.sandiego.gov,Apartment #4 has an increasing amount of homeless people frequenting in and out at all hours of the day and night taking excessive amounts of showers and noise disruptions. The tenant (John) is technically evicted but refuses to leave. He is a methanphetamine user and his behavior is getting more bizarre by the day. I'm concerned for everyone's safety and irritated by the noise and constant showers that affect my ability to get a hot shower with decent water pressure and consistent water pressure. The property manager is older and recommended we call the non emergency sips number,
