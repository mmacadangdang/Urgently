For some reason these guys don?t get it. It might be necessary to paint the curb red for those that don?t understand that you can?t park your car in the middle of the street.,no

People use our wall to hike themselves up onto the post, then lean, climb or sit on top of our wall. The capping on the wall is broken off and we have lost privacy from these people who stand on the post and look over onto our property.

SDG&E jack hammered away a section of concrete sidewalk and installed an emergency asphalt patch on 5 January to what was a clean, non-lifted concrete sidewalk along the south side of Division street. This was in the course of a emergency Saturday gas leak repair. SDG&E also drilled exploratory holes into adjacent sidewalk panels to which it did not patch. I request that those panels be replaced because these two-inch diameter holes will likely lead to water intrusion that will wash away the sidewalk foundation and cause further damage. SDG&E also drilled exploratory holes in Division Street which I also recommend the city get patched because of water intrusion risk. BACKGROUND: On 5 January, I called SDG&E's emergency hotline because I smelled gas in the area. SDG&E quickly dispatched a crew, closed the street, and drilled holes in the sidewalk, street, and landscape area. *I have more to write about this but this form won't let me*",no

Thought this might be a better place to file request then with Sidewalks/Curbs since it's a vegetation issue. Problem is that the ice plant growing on the City's parkway between the sidewalk & curb constantly overgrows the red curb allowing cars to park right up to the crosswalk. In the past I've suggest the ice plant be removed entirely from the City's property to prevent the re-occurrence and need for crews to return year after year to maintain it. After all, whoever planted the ice plant is obviously not maintaining it. Please remove all the ice plant from City property this time or another request will be made next year. The plant is a nuisance and costing the city's money. Thanks.",no

Every night this truck parks overnight right next to the sign that says No Overnight Parking. I manage the office building adjacent to this area and the oversized vehicles make it difficult for people to see oncoming traffic when exiting. We have over 600 cars here each day and people who work in the building often tell me how scary it is to pull out on Rio San Diego Dr, which is a curved street with lots of traffic. This truck is blatantly breaking the law because the driver knows the law wont' be enforced. He really does park here every night unless another truck or motor home gets to the spot first. If he was parking on the other side of the street I would not be filing complaints because that would not be causing a safety problem. I am trying to be proactive before an accident happens. Can we please paint the curb between the sign and the eastern exit of my parking lot red to stop this problem?",no

After 5 days in front of 1325, someone placed a note on the windshield of the van and asked for it to be moved. Someone had seen people entering the van at night. I started to believe someone may be sleeping in the van because there would be trash outside the van in the mornings. Yesterday, the van backup and parked it in front of 1339 W. Penn.

I'm the only car for blocks, but I have a red light. As I look at the other lights, it seems every direction has a red light. I wait maybe 45 sec, and the L turn green arrow turns (no car is there). After 20 sec or so it goes off. Great, now it must be my turn! Nope. The green L arrow comes backon again. On 20 sec, then goes off. Only after another 45 seconds do I get a green to go straight. The whole time, I'm the only car for blocks. It hasn't changed. You sit waiting to go straight East on Del Mar Heights, and the left turn lets 2 sequential green arrows, even there's no car in that lane!?

I have almost been hit at least three times, including today. The issue is that pedestrians crossing on the south west end of this intersection are not easily visible to cars that are turning left from Pangea Drive. I think there are several reasons for this that are out of the city's control (lots of plants on that side that act as shade and hide the pedestrian and also the location of the pedestrian is blinded by the car's left front pillar), but it will help if the timing for the pedestrian walk signal occurs before the light turns green for cars that are turning left. I crossed today and I could tell that the car that was coming towards me did not initially see me or even while I was crossing, so I ran. I looked back at her and it still appears she did not see me. Apologies if this is confusing, but please feel free to call me at 9517642006. This has happened many times and I am concerned someone will get hit.",no

I first reported this problem in March 2018. Work was being done at the time to curb-side storm drains just down the hill near Park Village Road; perhaps this report was erroneously closed in association with that work? My concern is with a storm drain cover (access point? whatever one calls the round things in the middle of the road, not at the curb). This one sits significantly below the level of the asphalt and has gotten deeper with the passage of time. It's right where three lanes merge into two. Depending on traffic it is sometimes impossible to swerve to avoid driving through it and it gives a serious jolt. Several months ago, well before the start of the rainy season, it appeared that someone might have tried to fill the space with dry concrete mix but it was gradually dispersed by traffic, perhaps the action of a frustrated resident. Please reevaluate this location. P.S. there is no good category match for this problem.",no

Earlier this morning i took my child to school and with all hopes of my parking space to be there, since it was pretty early. Once i came back my lovely neighbor who is handicapped has a blue spot specifically only for her, was parked in the spot that i had hoped to come back to. What i always notice is she either does it on purpose so once her family arrives she gives them the slot thats not handicapped. Then im left circiling my entire block for a parking spot, when i could have had my spot. Is there something you can do to better resolve this issue? I just it completely unfair that she basically screws all of the neighbors since none of us are handicapped. Please and thank you.",no

It could be addressed in a couple ways: either by changing the timing of this light with respect to the next light north (@ Soledad Mtn Rd / La Jolla Scenic Dr) or by ENFORCING traffic laws. In specific, vehicles turning left from Nautilus onto La Jolla Scenic consistently pull into the intersection before their way out is clear, thus causing northbound vehicles on La Jolla Scenic to have to wait for them to clear before passing the intersection. This can take some time due to the timing of the light at Soledad Mtn Rd/La Jolla Scenic. It also slows the passage of southbound vehicles turning left onto Cardeno Dr. This means that only about 1/3 of the time the light is green is safe for cars to use the intersection. It also leads to cars dangerously whipping up the right turn lane and then cutting back into the straight lane, again causing backups.

Things got a lot worse in February 2017 when a river like totally flooded my backyard, and patio. It almost flooded my living room. I strongly complained to the city, and since them the city sends a crew with a pump whenever there is a heavy rain forecast. It has worked fine and prevented us from being flooded until this past Saturday night 01/05/2019 When the rain storm was at its peak, my backyard and patio got a river like flood from the storm drain, and was within one inch of entering my house. The city crew and pump were here, but could not avoid the flooding. I tried to talk to your crew from my backyard but they could not hear me because of the water pump engine noise I assume. My whole family worked very hard to push the water away from the patio toward the down slope to the street, and barely avoided flooding our house. Please, send someone to investigate the problem.

In the center lane heading North on Qualcomm Way, the trench patchwork appeared washed out on the right side of that lane on Friday 2/8/19 at around 12:30pm when I drove my 2010 Mercedes S550 across the trench marks and heard a loud slam from the front right and rear of the vehicle. At that moment the front right tire was rendered flat immediately, and the right rear tire experienced a cut from the rim. Also, upon having the vehicle towed by AAA to the Mercedes Benz of San Diego Dealership the service department determined upon attempting to replace the tires that the front right rim was bent and required replacement, and an alignment would also be necessary.

Stormwater services told me to contact Streets Division, as the road itself seems to be the problem. There are no storm drains nearby. 3 roads flow into one channel that is directly in front of my propertyand this channel is not able to support the amount of water flow that it receives. Once the water hits the channel, it has to flow slightly uphill towards the main road (47th) to flow towards the one and only storm drain in this area. Once the channel is full/overflowing, any vehicles that drive through here, force the water into my yard as well as a few of my neighbors. This causes flooding on the residence properties as well. I have attached a few recent photos. I also have videos that can be provided of the flooding issues.

We suspect that the crumbling brow ditch, in green, or the storm drain, in red, might play a role. Could we please have the storm drain checked for integrity? We'd also like to have the brow ditch repaired. It is on city property. You may call me for more information. Also Eleanor Martinez/HOA manager at (858) 536-8100. Thank you!",yes

There is a constant steady flow of water running down the curb. Last week my wife slipped and fell while getting into our car hurting her elbow and knee. She slipped on the mildew that has grown and accumulated all up and down the curb on our street. I have complained to the city about it several times in the 10 years that we have lived here. Previously, I mentioned the disgusting smell that the wind brings into our house during the summer when the heat makes this mildew airborne and causes allergy symptoms with my wife and kids. When there was no action, then I tried mentioning the waste of water that this is causing, as it seems that this water is coming from a fire hydrant up the block, and we were being asked by the city to conserve water due to the drought.
